- [ ] CPU usage reasonable

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: MediaPipe model not found
**Symptom**: `java.io.FileNotFoundException: hand_landmarker.task`

**Solution**:
```bash
# Verify file exists
ls android/app/src/main/assets/hand_landmarker.task

# If missing, download it:
curl -O https://storage.googleapis.com/mediapipe-models/hand_landmarker/hand_landmarker/float16/1/hand_landmarker.task
mv hand_landmarker.task android/app/src/main/assets/
```

### Issue: Camera permission denied
**Symptom**: Black screen, no camera feed

**Solution**:
- Check AndroidManifest.xml has camera permission
- Uninstall app and reinstall
- Manually grant camera permission in device settings

### Issue: Gestures not detected
**Symptom**: "â€”" displayed even when making gestures

**Solution**:
- Ensure good lighting
- Hold hand 30-50cm from camera
- Hold gesture steady for 1-2 seconds
- Try adjusting finger positions
- Check [GESTURE_GUIDE.md](GESTURE_GUIDE.md:1) for tuning

### Issue: Build fails with Gradle errors
**Symptom**: `FAILURE: Build failed with an exception`

**Solution**:
```bash
cd android
./gradlew clean
cd ..
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

### Issue: Tests fail
**Symptom**: Widget tests don't pass

**Solution**:
```bash
flutter pub get
flutter test
```

## Release Preparation

### Before Release
- [ ] Update version in pubspec.yaml
- [ ] Test on multiple devices
- [ ] Test in different lighting conditions
- [ ] Document known limitations
- [ ] Update README with actual device test results

### App Signing (Production)
If publishing to Play Store:

1. Generate keystore:
```bash
keytool -genkey -v -keystore ~/upload-keystore.jks -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias upload
```

2. Update `android/app/build.gradle.kts` with signing config

3. Build signed APK:
```bash
flutter build apk --release
```

### APK Distribution
- **Debug APK**: For internal testing
  - Location: `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-debug.apk`
  - Size: ~50-70 MB

- **Release APK**: For production
  - Location: `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk`
  - Size: ~30-50 MB (optimized)

## QA Sign-Off

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Real-time hand gesture detection
- [ ] 7 gestures recognized correctly
- [ ] Educational Learn screen
- [ ] No ML training required
- [ ] MediaPipe integration works

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] Builds successfully on Android
- [ ] Runs on Android 7.0+ (API 24+)
- [ ] Camera permission handling
- [ ] Smooth UI interactions
- [ ] Acceptable performance

### Documentation Requirements
- [ ] README complete with setup instructions
- [ ] MediaPipe model download guide
- [ ] Gesture tuning documentation
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Code comments present

## Final Verification

Run this command to verify everything:
```bash
# Clean and rebuild
flutter clean
flutter pub get

# Run tests
flutter test

# Analyze code
flutter analyze

# Build release APK
flutter build apk --release
```

All should complete without errors (except assets warnings - those are expected until MediaPipe model is added).

## Deployment Status

**Current Status**: âœ… **READY FOR TESTING**

**Blockers**:
- ðŸš¨ **CRITICAL**: MediaPipe `hand_landmarker.task` must be added before running

**Next Steps**:
1. Download MediaPipe model
2. Add to `android/app/src/main/assets/`
3. Run `flutter run` on Android device
4. Test all gestures
5. Document results
